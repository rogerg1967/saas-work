# SaaS Work

SaaS Work is a platform providing UK GDPR-compliant AI chatbots to organizations. Built using Vue.js and Express, it offers role-based access, user management, and payment integration to ensure seamless chatbot deployment and management for UK organizations.

## Overview

SaaS Work employs a dual architecture comprising a ReactJS-based frontend and an Express-based backend. The frontend is set up in the `client/` folder, using Vite as the development server, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Shadcn-ui component library. The backend resides in the `server/` folder, implementing REST API endpoints and employing MongoDB for data storage with Mongoose as an ORM.
