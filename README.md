# SaaS Work

SaaS Work is a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform designed to provide UK GDPR compliant AI chatbots to organizations. Built using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS for the frontend and integrated with a MongoDB database, it ensures secure and efficient data handling. The platform's primary aim is to facilitate AI-powered customer interactions while maintaining strict adherence to GDPR guidelines.

## Overview

This project is structured into two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

1. **Frontend**: Developed using Vue.js with Tailwind CSS for styling, and integrated with the shadcn-ui component library. The frontend manages routing with react-router-dom and is organized under the `client/` directory, with pages and components broadly separated.
    - **Main Port**: 5173
    - **Key Folders**: `client/src/pages/`, `client/src/components/`

2. **Backend**: Built using Express.js, providing RESTful API endpoints aggregated under the `api/` directory. It handles user authentication, subscription management, and chatbot functionalities, utilizing MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.
    - **Main Port**: 3000
    - **Key Folders**: `server/routes/`, `server/models/`, `server/services/`

The application uses concurrently to run both the frontend and backend with a single npm command, ensuring a streamlined development process.
