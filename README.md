# SaaS Work

SaaS Work is a comprehensive Software as a Service (SaaS) platform designed to provide UK GDPR-compliant AI chatbots to organizations. Built using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS on the frontend, and Node.js with Express for the backend, the platform integrates various core features to enhance user experience and facilitate chatbot management. The primary aim is to offer a detailed and professional platform, emphasizing clear information, subscription management, and seamless interaction with AI services.

## Overview

SaaS Work utilizes a two-part architecture consisting of a React-based frontend and an Express-based backend. The frontend is built using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern user interface, while the backend implements various REST API endpoints to handle user authentication, subscription management, and AI chatbot interactions. MongoDB is used as the primary database, managed through Mongoose, ensuring robust and scalable data handling. The project leverages JWT for authentication and Stripe for managing user subscriptions and payments.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:
- `client/`: Contains the frontend code, built with React.js using Vite for development and testing. It includes various components, pages, and API integration for handling UI logic and data fetching.
- `server/`: Contains the backend code, which includes route definitions, middleware, services, and database models. It manages user authentication, subscription verification, and other core backend functionalities.

## Features

- **AI Chatbots**: Provides an interface to create, edit, and delete AI chatbots, configure chatbot settings, and manage conversation threads.
- **Subscription Management**: Users can manage their subscriptions, view current plans, suspend subscriptions, and access Stripe invoices.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implements roles like SaaS Admin, Organization Manager, and Team Member to control access and permissions within the platform.
- **GDPR Compliance**: Ensures data handling and privacy according to UK GDPR guidelines.
- **Dynamic AI Integration**: Fetches and updates the latest models from AI providers like OpenAI, ensuring users have access to the most current AI capabilities.
- **Error Handling**: Provides user-friendly error messages and robust error handling throughout the platform.
- **Real-Time Data**: Updates the active users panel on the dashboard in real-time, reflecting current platform user activity.
- **User Profile Management**: Allows users to update their personal details, manage profiles, and reset passwords securely.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Ensure the following technologies/setup are installed on your computer:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (local or remote instance)
- Stripe account for managing subscription payments

### Quickstart

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/saas-work.git
   cd saas-work
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in both the `client/` and `server/` directories with the necessary environment variables. Example:

   For `server/.env`:
   ```dotenv
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/saaswork
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_jwt_secret
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
   ```

   For `client/.env`:
   ```dotenv
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
   VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
   ```

4. **Start the Application**:
   ```shell
   npm run start
   ```

   This command runs both the client and server simultaneously using `concurrently`.

5. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to interact with the frontend.
