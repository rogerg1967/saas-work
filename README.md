# SaaS Work

SaaS Work is a high-performance SaaS platform designed to provide UK GDPR-compliant AI chatbots to organizations. Built with Vue.js and Tailwind CSS on the frontend and Node.js with Express on the backend, this platform allows organizations to manage chatbots while ensuring stringent data privacy and security.

## Overview

### Architecture
SaaS Work features a robust architectural design, leveraging a combination of modern technologies to deliver a smooth and secure user experience. The project comprises a frontend application built using React.js and Tailwind CSS, and a backend server implemented with Node.js and Express. Data is stored and managed using MongoDB, with Mongoose for object data modeling.

### Project Structure
The project is divided into two main parts:
1. **Frontend**: Located in the `client/` directory, it uses React.js with client-side routing provided by React Router Dom. Vite is used as the build tool and development server.
2. **Backend**: Found in the `server/` directory, it runs a Node.js server using Express to handle RESTful API calls. MongoDB is used for the database, with Mongoose for schema management and interaction.

The backend handles user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure access and refresh tokens. Stripe is integrated for managing subscription payments.

## Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Supports various user roles including SaaS Admin, Organization Manager, and Team Member.
- **GDPR Compliance**: Ensures data privacy and protection in compliance with UK GDPR regulations.
- **AI Chatbots**: Provides an interface to create, manage, and interact with AI chatbots.
- **User Management**: Includes sophisticated user and organization management features.
- **Stripe Integration**: Facilitates subscription payments and securely manages customer transactions.
- **Modern UI**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS and shadcn-ui components for a modern and responsive user interface.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

To run the project locally, you'll need:

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- npm (v6 or above)
- MongoDB (running instance)
- Stripe account (for handling subscriptions)
- Environment variables set up in `.env` files

### Quickstart

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/saas-work.git
   cd saas-work
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   **Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

   **Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in both the `client/` and `server/` directories with the necessary configurations. For example:

   **server/.env**
   ```plaintext
   DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/saaswork
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   ```

   **client/.env**
   ```plaintext
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**
   From the project root, run:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   This will start both the frontend on port 5173 and the backend on port 3000 concurrently.

5. **Access the Application**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to access the frontend application.
